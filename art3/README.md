# Art #3
For this art installment I did two differnt things. First, I made a heat map of the percentage of the state that is infected with the virus. Viewable [here]https://github.com/austinmccalley/engr352/tree/master/art3/photos/map)


Second, I made a plot of the delta change in the number of cases for each state then a line of best fit for the following amount of days. Viewable [here]https://github.com/austinmccalley/engr352/tree/master/art3/photos/plots)
